# QuiverDatabase

## Dev Setup
1. Install Python 3.x if you need to.  Notes:
    - If you're new to python, try the latest: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - I recommend doing a custom install (option in installer) to "C:\Python39" for example (on Windows), but
    it is not required.
    - Make sure to select **Add To Path** in the installer.
    
2. Install Neo4j Desktop:
    - From here: https://neo4j.com/download/ 
    - Regardless of what you see on the screen, no API key is required (unless you're doing a commercial license), so skip any such screen.
    
3. Open Neo4j Desktop, and in the Primer project or any new project, create a local graph database.
    - The database can have any name (try maybe "Category Theory" or "Mathematics" if you want).
    - Use the password `fusion123` for now (this should match up later with WingWare project file setting).
    - Use default settings for everything else such as the Neo4j version.

4. Clone this repository (I use TortoiseGit Shell extension on Windows).
