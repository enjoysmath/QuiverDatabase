## Dev Setup
1. Install Python 3.x if you need to.  Notes:
    - If you're new to python, try the latest: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - I recommend doing a custom install (option in installer) to "C:\Python39" for example (on Windows), but
    it is not required.
    - Make sure to select **Add To Path** in the installer.
2. Install Neo4j Desktop:
